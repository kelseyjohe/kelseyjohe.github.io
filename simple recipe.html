            You'll never drink milk without steak again.

            <h3> Ingredients </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Whole Milk - 2 cups</li>
                <li>Steak - 8 ounces</li>
                <li>Honey - 1/4 cup</li>
                <li>Cinnamon - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
                <li>Nutmeg - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
                <li>Vanilla Extract - 1 teaspoon</li>
                <br>
                If you're feeling fancy, consider pairing with
                1/2 cup of your local liquor store's finest jelly beans
            </ul>
            <p>
                <h3> Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the milk, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to a medium sized saucepan.</li>

                    <li>Heat up the mixture, stirring until the honey has completely dissolved.</li>

                    <li> Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>

                    <li> Carefully place the steak in the boiling milk mixture. </li>

                    <li> Bring the liquid back to the boil and reduce the heat so that the milk is simmering. </li>
                    <li>Cook this medium-sized steak for five minutes on one side, stirring the top occasionally to stop a skin forming on the milk.</li>
                    <li>
                        Turn the steak over and cook for a further five minutes on the other side. </li>
                    <li>Check how well cooked your steak is. If you're after authenticity, the steak should be cooked "over hard" and so should not be pink at all. </li>
                    <li>Allow the steak to chill for a few minutes, its been through a lot</li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Bonus Step</strong>
                        <li> Garnish with jelly beans. </li>
                </ol>
